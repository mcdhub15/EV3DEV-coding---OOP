# EV3DEV-coding---OOP

Need a better IDE than SSH Nano
Nano edits are prone to TabError.   We want to use VS Code with EV3DEV Browser Extension provided by dlech and github community.  We want to write more interesting programs for our EV3 robots that involve AI, ML and OOP.   How can I create a custom class to manage the gyrosensor?   We want the robot to do something cool when it gets hit by another robot where angle and rate variables are changed.
